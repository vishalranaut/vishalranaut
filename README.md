### Signal bar
- 🎯 5+ yrs shipping at scale (B2B + consumer)
- 🎨 Design-system minded; accessible, themeable UI kits
- ⚡ Fast feedback: crisp PRs, benchmarks over vibes
- 🛰️ Cloud fluent: AWS/GCP/Azure, edge/serverless when it pays

### Signature moves
- **Frontend:** product-ready component libraries, resilient form/state patterns, accessibility first.
- **Backend:** clean contracts (REST/GraphQL/tRPC), auth/rate limits done right, caching that earns its keep.
- **Systems:** pragmatic microservices, Kafka/RabbitMQ for events, CI/CD tuned for fast loops.
- **Data:** Postgres/Mongo/Redis, schema design, migrations, performance you can measure.


### How I work
- Start with the smallest shippable slice and a clear success metric.
- Living architecture notes (decision logs > heavy diagrams).
- Demo early, test in CI, measure in prod; no surprise migrations.
- Direct async comms, crisp PRs, and numbers to prove wins.

### Fit check — bring me in when…
- You need a design-system lead who sweats DX and accessibility.
- You want backend guardrails for auth, caching, and contract drift.
- You’re moving a React/Node stack to edge/serverless and need safety rails.
- You want cross-platform features without rewriting everything.
